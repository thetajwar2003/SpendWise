## Objective

SpendWise is a **Personal Finance Management App** designed to help users manage their finances effortlessly.

## Features

- **Subscription Management:** Identify recurring payments and send reminders for due subscriptions.
- **Financial Insights:** Generate detailed reports for monthly, quarterly, or annual financial performance.

## Motivation

Managing personal finances can be challenging, especially with multiple bank accounts and credit cards. Existing apps like Mint or YNAB have limitations such as intrusive ads and costly subscriptions. SpendWise aims to address these issues by providing:

Our app provides a **modern, ad-free, and highly customizable solution** for personal finance management.
